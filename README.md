# german-credit-gini-analysis

Gini calculation on German credit dataset based on "glm".

[click here for the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kabure/german-credit-data-with-risk)

In this project, the goal is to compare Gini values with **MLmetrics** and **sqldf** libraries on R.

As a result, Gini values are expected ***exactly the same***.
